# PARA-ATM documentation

## Building the documentation

To build the documentation on Linux, you need Make and Sphinx installed.  On Ubuntu, install sphinx with:

```
sudo apt install python3-sphinx
```

Then execute:

```
make html
```

You can then see the documentation by opening in a browser `_build/html/index.html`.
