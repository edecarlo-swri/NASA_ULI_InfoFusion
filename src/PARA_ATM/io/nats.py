# Note: NatsEnvironment is implemented as a class wtih static methods.
# The same effect could be achieved using globally defined functions
# and state variables, but the class is used in order to provide some
# organization and encapuslation.
#
# Implementation of these utilities was challenging because the JVM
# and NATS servers can only be started once.  After they are stopped,
# they cannot be started again within the same Python process.  This
# is why we need global (static) variables to track the state and trap
# conditions that would otherwise lead to crashes.
#
# Other approaches that were considered: Use of a context manager
# class was considered, which is nice because it clearly delineates
# where in the code the environment is valid and will handle shtudown
# once the context exits.  The problem is that the JVM can't be
# started again, so only one such context instatiation would be
# allowed.  A regular class was also considered (not using static
# methods and state), but there is the same issue: since the JVM
# cannot be restarted, only once such instance could be created.
