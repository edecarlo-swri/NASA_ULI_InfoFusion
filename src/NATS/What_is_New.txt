National Airspace Trajectory-Prediction System(NATS)

Version: beta 1.7

Changes in this release:

1. A new standalone version of NATS has been designed to run on a single machine. Development of this version was motivated by a poll of the ULI user community.
   This new design integrates the previous server-client interaction and provides a simpler way to run trajectory propagation on the desktop. 

   Please view the sample files to understand how the new function calls work.

2. API Change
   ControllerInterface.setDelayPeriod(String acid, AircraftClearance aircraft_clearance, float seconds)
   Now it accepts float type data of delay period.

3. R Interface has been added to allow functions written in R to interact with NATS. Package "rJava" needs to be installed by running command install.packages("rJava") in R shell as follows:

   user@host:~/$ sudo R
   [sudo] password for user:
